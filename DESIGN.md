# Design

Visual system for Conversationaly. Every value here exists as a CSS custom
property in `frontend/src/app/globals.css` and, where useful, as a Tailwind
token in `frontend/tailwind.config.js`. **`globals.css` is the source of truth.**
No component may hardcode a Tailwind palette color (`bg-gray-50`, `text-blue-600`,
`bg-red-500`). If a color is needed that isn't here, add it here first.

## Theme

Two first-class themes. Default follows `prefers-color-scheme`; a manual override
persists to `localStorage` under `conversationaly.theme` and is applied by an
inline script in `<head>` before paint, so there is no flash.

Dark is the primary *working* theme (monitor-lit room, 90-minute session beside a
call). Light is the primary *reading* theme (bright room, reviewing a summary).
Neither is a downgrade of the other — they have independent token values, not a
filter.

## Color

OKLCH throughout. Hue anchors: **brand 110°** (olive), **danger 25°** (red),
**warn 72°** (amber), **info 262°** (indigo).

### Strategy: Restrained

Tinted neutrals carry ~92% of every surface. One brand color for identity,
primary action, and current selection. Red is not part of the palette — it is a
**signal**, reserved for live capture and destructive actions, and it appears
nowhere else. Success does not get its own hue: the brand olive *is* the success
color, so "working correctly" and "this product" read as the same thing.

Neutrals are tinted 0.004–0.014 chroma toward 110°. This is below the threshold
of "warm-tinted" — it keeps grays from reading as dead digital gray without
landing anywhere near cream.

### Light

| Role | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `oklch(1 0 0)` | Canvas. Pure white — the transcript and summary are documents. |
| `--panel` | `oklch(0.976 0.004 110)` | Sidebar, toolbars, rails. The second neutral layer. |
| `--elevated` | `oklch(1 0 0)` | Popovers, dialogs, menus. Sits on a scrim with a border + shadow. |
| `--sunken` | `oklch(0.968 0.005 110)` | Input wells, code, inset readouts. |
| `--border` | `oklch(0.912 0.006 110)` | Default hairline. |
| `--border-strong` | `oklch(0.855 0.008 110)` | Input outlines, dividers that must read. |
| `--ink` | `oklch(0.215 0.013 110)` | Body text. **17.5:1** on `--bg`. |
| `--ink-muted` | `oklch(0.46 0.014 110)` | Secondary text. **7.1:1** — deliberately darker than the usual muted gray. |
| `--ink-faint` | `oklch(0.54 0.012 110)` | Tertiary / metadata. **5.1:1**. |
| `--brand` | `oklch(0.365 0.082 110)` | Primary buttons, active nav, success. White text: 11.3:1. |
| `--brand-hover` | `oklch(0.315 0.078 110)` | |
| `--brand-soft` | `oklch(0.955 0.022 110)` | Selection / active-row tint. |
| `--brand-soft-ink` | `oklch(0.33 0.075 110)` | Text on `--brand-soft`. 10.7:1. |
| `--danger` | `oklch(0.545 0.205 25)` | Record button, destructive fills. White text: 4.95:1. |
| `--danger-ink` | `oklch(0.47 0.19 25)` | Red text on canvas. 6.8:1. |
| `--danger-soft` | `oklch(0.962 0.022 25)` | Destructive-state backgrounds. |
| `--warn` / `--warn-ink` / `--warn-soft` | `oklch(0.72 0.15 72)` / `oklch(0.47 0.11 72)` / `oklch(0.966 0.03 72)` | Permission gaps, degraded state. |
| `--info` / `--info-ink` / `--info-soft` | `oklch(0.52 0.115 262)` / `oklch(0.52 0.115 262)` / `oklch(0.962 0.018 262)` | Local-model and device readouts. 5.5:1. |

### Dark

| Role | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `oklch(0.155 0.004 110)` | Canvas. |
| `--panel` | `oklch(0.185 0.005 110)` | Sidebar, toolbars. |
| `--elevated` | `oklch(0.225 0.006 110)` | Popovers, dialogs. |
| `--sunken` | `oklch(0.125 0.004 110)` | Input wells. |
| `--border` | `oklch(0.285 0.007 110)` | |
| `--border-strong` | `oklch(0.37 0.009 110)` | |
| `--ink` | `oklch(0.945 0.006 110)` | **16.7:1**. |
| `--ink-muted` | `oklch(0.72 0.011 110)` | **7.9:1**. |
| `--ink-faint` | `oklch(0.625 0.01 110)` | **5.0:1**. |

**All three ink tiers clear 4.5:1 against all four surfaces (`bg`, `panel`,
`sunken`, `elevated`) in both themes** — verified by measuring the rendered
values in the browser, not by eye. There is deliberately no "large text only"
tier: in a codebase this size that becomes a footgun the moment someone reaches
for the lightest gray on a caption.
| `--brand` | `oklch(0.8 0.115 110)` | Bright sage. **Takes dark ink, not white** — `--brand-ink` `oklch(0.16 0.03 110)`, 10.4:1. |
| `--brand-soft` | `oklch(0.255 0.032 110)` | |
| `--danger` | `oklch(0.55 0.21 25)` | Held at L 0.55 so white text still passes (4.9:1). |
| `--danger-ink` | `oklch(0.72 0.16 25)` | 7.9:1. |

The brand flips polarity between themes: a deep olive that carries white text in
light, a bright sage that carries dark text in dark. This is intentional — it is
what keeps the accent legible without either theme feeling like a tint of the
other.

## Typography

**One superfamily: IBM Plex.** Three optical registers, shared metrics, designed
together — not a pairing of two similar sans.

- **Plex Sans** (`--font-sans`) — all UI chrome, labels, buttons, navigation,
  transcript body. Speech is not prose; sans is the honest setting for it.
- **Plex Serif** (`--font-serif`) — generated summary body and large meeting
  titles only. The review surface is a document and should read like one.
- **Plex Mono** (`--font-mono`) — timestamps, durations, model IDs, device names,
  confidence values, file paths, version. Anything that is a *machine fact*.
  This is principle 3 made visible: the local machinery is set in a typeface
  that says "readout".

Fixed rem scale, 16px root, ratio ~1.08 at UI sizes and ~1.2 above. No `clamp()` —
users view at a consistent DPI and a fluid heading in a 256px sidebar looks worse.

| Token | Size / line-height | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `text-2xs` | 11 / 15 | Mono readouts, timestamps |
| `text-xs` | 12 / 17 | Captions, meta |
| `text-sm` | 13 / 19 | Dense labels, buttons |
| `text-base` | 14 / 21 | Default UI body |
| `text-md` | 15 / 24 | Transcript body |
| `text-lg` | 17 / 27 | Summary body (serif) |
| `text-xl` | 20 / 27 | Panel titles |
| `text-2xl` | 25 / 31 | Page titles |
| `text-3xl` | 31 / 37 | Meeting title |

Prose measure capped at 68ch (`--measure`) on the **live** transcript, where the
column is the whole surface and nothing else competes for the width.

The **generated summary does not use it** — it runs the full width of its pane.
A summary is not only prose: it carries action-item tables and reference
columns, and a 68ch cap clipped them while leaving the rest of a wide pane
empty. Its measure is the pane, and the pane is the user's to drag. The only
horizontal inset is BlockNote's left gutter (54px, where the block handles
live) plus 24px on the right.

`text-wrap: balance` on titles, `pretty` on prose.

## Shape & elevation

Radii are tight — instrument, not app-store icon.

`--r-sm 4px` · `--r-md 6px` · `--r-lg 10px` · `--r-xl 14px` · `--r-full 999px`

Elevation is border-first: a hairline always, a shadow only when the element
genuinely floats (popover, dialog, the recording transport). Two shadow tokens,
`--shadow-pop` and `--shadow-float`. No shadow on static cards.

## Layout

- Sidebar rail: 304px expanded / 56px collapsed, `--panel`, hairline right
  border. Expanded on launch — the meeting list is the app's content, not an
  optional drawer. Rail rows, meeting titles and the search field are set one
  step down the scale (`text-xs`) from the app's default: the rail is dense
  navigation, and 12px buys a meeting title several more words before it
  truncates.
- **Panes are user-resizable, pane widths persist, collapse does not.** Two
  dividers — rail│content and transcript│summary — each a 5px hit target
  straddling the hairline the pane already draws: nothing at rest, a `--brand`
  rule while grabbed, double-click to reset. Widths are stored under
  `conversationaly.panes` and restored before first paint by an inline script,
  the same treatment the theme gets; a *collapse* stays a per-session gesture.
  Defaults live in `globals.css` (`--rail-w`, `--pane-transcript`) and the drag
  bounds in `lib/panes.ts`. A drag writes the custom property directly, never
  React state — the virtualized transcript may not re-render per pointer frame.
  CSS carries the safety net for a shrinking window (`min()` on the rail,
  `max-width` on the transcript pane), so no window size and no stored width
  can starve the pane after it.
- **One rail axis.** `--rail-gutter` (8px, exposed to Tailwind as `px-gutter`)
  insets every zone, and every row pads by it again, so each row's content box
  starts at 2×gutter: the brand mark, the Home icon, the search icon, the
  section label and every meeting title land on one vertical line. A row that
  carries an icon puts its label at 2×gutter + icon + gap. Hardcoded `px-2` /
  `px-3` / `px-5` in the rail is a bug — the four competing insets they
  produced are what made the rail read as assembled rather than drawn.
- **The rail has five zones, in rank order:** identity · capture · find ·
  views + meetings *(the only scrolling zone)* · utilities. The primary action
  never sits below a scrolling list, and the capture zone holds its height
  across every route and state — changing route must not shuffle the rail out
  from under the pointer. Where a page owns the capture control itself (Home,
  via the transport), the zone reports capture state rather than shipping a
  second control for the same thing.
- Content max measure 68ch for prose; toolbars and tables run full width.
- Responsive behavior is **structural** (collapse the rail, stack the two-pane
  meeting view below 1100px), never fluid type.
- The recording transport is `position: fixed`, bottom-centered on the content
  column, and offsets with the rail via a CSS variable, not inline style math.

## Motion

Tokens: `--dur-fast 120ms` · `--dur 180ms` · `--dur-slow 260ms`,
easing `--ease` `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`.

Motion reports state and nothing else — a level changing, a status advancing, a
segment arriving, a panel collapsing. There is no page-load choreography: the
current `motion.div` fade-and-rise on every route mount is removed. It makes a
tool the user opens forty times a day feel slow.

The rail collapse is instant. Animating the rail width and the content column's
margin re-ran layout on every frame for 260ms, and the thing being re-laid-out
is a virtualized transcript that can hold thousands of rows. Motion may report
state; it may not make reporting state cost a relayout.

`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` → all durations collapse to 1ms except opacity
crossfades, and the audio level meter stops animating and renders a static
numeric readout instead. Reduced motion must not remove information.

## Z-index

Semantic scale only. No arbitrary values.

`--z-sticky 200` · `--z-rail 300` · `--z-overlay 400` · `--z-modal 500` ·
`--z-dropdown 550` · `--z-toast 600` · `--z-tooltip 700`

Transient layers — dropdown, select, popover, tooltip — sit **above** modal.
They portal to `<body>`, so a menu opened inside a dialog is a sibling of the
dialog, not a child: below it means invisible.

## Component rules

- Every interactive element ships all seven states: default, hover, focus-visible,
  active, disabled, loading, error. Half a set is a bug.
- One button vocabulary across every screen: `primary` (brand fill), `secondary`
  (border + `--panel`), `ghost` (transparent, hover tint), `danger` (red fill).
  Sizes `sm` / `md`. Nothing else.
- Loading is a skeleton in content areas; a spinner only inside a button or on a
  control smaller than 32px.
- Empty states teach the next action and name it as a button.
- **Two selection languages, never one.** *Chrome* selection — the route you
  are on, the tab you are in — is a filled surface: `--brand-soft` with
  `--brand-soft-ink` for a rail row, a 2px `--brand` underline for a tab strip.
  *Item* selection — an open meeting, the chosen model, the active audio
  backend, a selected summary block — is a **brand border, never a fill**: a
  2px `--brand` edge in the gutter for a list row, a `--brand` hairline for a
  card, and the status word ("Selected", "Active") set in `--brand`. Selection
  is always brand. `--info` is for local-model and device *readouts*; using it
  for selection made every selected card read as a status callout.
- A control in the collapsed rail must do what its label says. Expanding the
  rail is not "search" — if the label says search, the click also lands the
  cursor in the field.
- **Highlight is not selection.** The keyboard/pointer highlight inside a menu,
  select, or command list is neutral (`--ink` at 5%). Brand marks the *chosen*
  item — the check on a `SelectItem`, the border on a card. A primitive that
  paints its highlight brand makes every hover look like a commitment.
- **Fields are wells.** Input, textarea and the select trigger share one
  treatment: `--sunken` fill, `--border-strong` outline, `--brand` border on
  focus, and the app's one global `:focus-visible` ring on top. A primitive must
  never set `outline-none` to install a ring of its own.
- **Tooltips are not brand.** A tooltip is neither identity, primary action, nor
  selection: `--elevated` with a hairline and `--shadow-pop`.
- **Two tab voices.** `segmented` is the in-panel switch (sunken track, active
  option raised to `--elevated`); `underline` is the page-level view switcher (a
  hairline under the strip, typography carrying state). The `underline` variant
  draws no indicator — the caller owns it, so Settings keeps its spring.
- Floating surfaces (menu, popover, select, tooltip, command) are `--elevated` +
  hairline + `--shadow-pop`, and they **fade only**. Zoom and slide on an opening
  menu is choreography, not state.
- Focus ring: `2px` `--ring` with a `2px` `--bg` offset, on `:focus-visible` only.
- Recording state is never communicated by color alone — the live indicator is a
  filled dot **plus** the word "Recording" **plus** an elapsed mono timer.
